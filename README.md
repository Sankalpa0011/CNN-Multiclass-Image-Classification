- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `keras`
  - `layers`: `Input`, `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Activation`, `Flatten`, `Dropout`, `BatchNormalization`
  - `models`: `Sequential`
  - `preprocessing.image`: `ImageDataGenerator`
  - `callbacks`: `TensorBoard`, `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`
  - `regularizers`: `l2`
  - `optimizers`: `Adam`
- `datetime`
- `skimage.transform`: `resize`
